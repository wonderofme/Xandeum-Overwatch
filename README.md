## ⚡ Mission Brief

We built **Overwatch** to solve the "Excel Sheet Problem." Most node explorers are boring tables. Xandeum is a high-tech storage network, and it deserves a high-tech interface.

**Overwatch** replaces pagination with immersion. It is a single-screen "Glass Cockpit" designed for node operators who need instant situational awareness.

## 🏆 Key Capabilities

### 1. 🌍 The "Dark Matter" Recon Map

A custom-engineered 3D visualization that renders Xandeum nodes as active signals on a dark-mode globe.

- **Satellite View:** Filters out map noise to focus purely on node distribution.

- **Interactive Intel:** Click any signal to expand node telemetry.

### 2. ⭐ Client-Side "Targeting" (Bookmarks)

Zero-login persistence.

- Users can "Target" (Bookmark) specific nodes to track them.

- Data is stored locally in the browser, respecting user privacy while providing persistence across sessions.

### 3. 📊 Tactical Analytics HUD

Real-time visualization of network health.

- **Capacity Modeling:** 30-day projection of storage growth.

- **Decentralization Radar:** Visual breakdown of node regions.

- **Gamification:** Automatic detection of the "Network Leader" (Top Node).
